Since PHP/5.2.0 there is a feature json_encode() and json_decode(), but the choice of this class is preferable.

JSON::encode() features

Not only works with UTF-8, but also with any other single-byte encodings (eg: windows-1251, koi8-r)
Is able to convert numbers represented a string data type into the corresponding numeric data types (optional)
Non-ASCII characters leave as is, and does not convert to \uXXXX.
JSON::decode() features

Converts malformed JSON to well-formed JSON.
Hint: normalizes a "dirty" JSON string, coming from JavaScript (smart behavior -- only if necessary)
